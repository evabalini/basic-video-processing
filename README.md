# basic-video-processing

This is the code for an assignment for the course of Computer Vision. 
Various processing techniques were applied to a video. 
A link to the video will be provided soon. 

The techniques and tranforms applied were the following: 
-Grayscale 
-Grabbing color in RGB color space
-Grabbing color in HSV color space
-Gaussian and bilateral filtering with different kernels
-Dilation 
-Opening 
-Sobel edge detection with different parameters
-Circle detection with Hough Transform
-Template Matching 
-Grayscale likelihood map, with intensity values proportional to the likelihood that an item (the template) is in that position 
-Unblurring frames
-Detect lines with Hough Transform
-Detect Eyes (circle detection with Hough Transform)
-Track ball based on color
