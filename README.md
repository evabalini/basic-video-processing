###Techniques and transfroms: 
-Grayscale 
-Grabbing color in RGB color space
-Grabbing color in HSV color space
-Gaussian and bilateral filtering with different kernels
-Dilation 
-Opening 

-Sobel edge detection with different parameters

-Circle detection with Hough Transform

-Template Matching 

-Grayscale likelihood map, with intensity values proportional to the likelihood that an item (the template) is in that position 

-Unblurring frames

-Detect lines with Hough Transform

-Detect Eyes (circle detection with Hough Transform)

-Track ball based on color
